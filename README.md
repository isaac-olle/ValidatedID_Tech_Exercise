# ValidatedID_Tech_Exercise
  There is 2 interfaces to interact with the program. They are defined in index.js, you can comment them if you feel it neccessary.
 ## Terminal 
   Very useful interface for testing, it runs automatically all the game until one player is the winner.T
  This interface actually does not need all the logic that it has, it could just run the game using the logic itself.
  It has been adapted to the http to show the scalability of the system, and also simulates a frontend playing.
## HTTP one
  Can be used with postman, there is the colection in the repository. GameId is automatically set for the adjacent requests.
The limit cases has not been testes, the error managment is limited.
